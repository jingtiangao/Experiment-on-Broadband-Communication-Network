# Experiment on Broadband Communication Network
- Used Wireshark to analyze the number of URL first packets and RTT time.
- Calculated the theoretical fastest time to transmit 128KB without server delay response (slow-
start algorithm is exponential growth) under conditions of 50ms delay, no packet loss, jitter free
network.
- Used iptables to analyze characteristics of TCP retransmission timer respectively under the system
of CENTOS-5, CENTOS-6, WIN7.â€¢ Used Dns Tunnel tool (like iodine) to traverse the campus gateway billing system to access Internet
bypassing WEB portal authentication.
